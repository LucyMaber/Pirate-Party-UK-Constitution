## (4) MEMBERSHIP
Membership is open to:
- Citizens of the United Kingdom
- Resident Foreign Nationals
- Those who possess a right to vote on behalf of the United Kingdom in Local, General, or Supranational elections
- Other Foreign Nationals at the discretion of the National Executive Committee (“NEC”)

Members shall not share membership with any organization that has been declared to be incompatible with membership of the Party by the NEC.

Members must pay membership fees as set by the NEC, as described in Section 5.

Members shall not act in a manner that brings the party into disrepute or is likely to bring the party into disrepute. If a member is suspected of behaving in such a fashion, they will be asked to explain their actions to a disciplinary committee formed by the NEC as per the arbitration and disciplinary rules of Section 10.

Members appointed or elected to a position may be relieved of their title and responsibilities should the NEC find them absent for a period exceeding 28 days without prior notice.
## (5) THE NATIONAL EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE

The National Executive Committee (NEC) shall consist of the following officers, each with specific roles and responsibilities:

- **The Leader:** Heads the party's administration and represents the party to the media and electorate. This NEC officer is expected to stand as a candidate in general and other relevant elections and to take a leading role in setting political strategy. The Leader will also set time aside to support other candidates on campaigning and political issues. The Leader will normally chair NEC meetings.

- **The Treasurer:** Responsible for the party's finances, including membership fees and campaign expenditure, and is legally responsible for making sure that the party complies with the Political Parties, Elections, and Referendums Act (2000). The Electoral Commission's guidance for treasurers provides more details of what the role's legal responsibilities entail. Within the party, the Treasurer is expected to process new memberships, as well as to manage and review existing memberships. The Treasurer is also responsible for fundraising and for reporting national campaign spending to the Electoral Commission.

- **The Nominating Officer:** Responsible for running internal elections and for authorizing candidates to stand on behalf of the party (official responsibilities outlined in the Representation of the People Act 1983), as well as for keeping the NEC up to date with election timetables as released by the Electoral Commission. The Nominating Officer is also expected to assist candidates with completion of nomination forms and other paperwork, and to maintain party details with the Electoral Commission.

The following roles are optional and can be added or removed by the NEC as needed:

- **The Campaigns Officer:** Responsible for internal and external campaigns, including conferences, demonstrations, and political awareness, as well as supporting candidates during election campaigning and coordinating press responses. Support for local campaigns may include research, printed material, web resources, and press support. The Campaigns team helps the Treasury team in relation to fundraising.

- **The Deputy Leader:** Supports the Leader in this role. In the event the Leader position is vacant, the Deputy Leader, for all intents and purposes, becomes the Acting Leader. Once an election has run and a new Leader has been elected, the then Acting Leader reverts to the Deputy Leader.

- **The Secretary:** Acts as the party's Data Controller, responsible for handling stored data and making sure we comply with Data Protection laws. The Secretary also organizes and minutes NEC meetings and oversees the Secretariat, which manages party-internal communication, including answering and maintaining the party's membership base. As Data Controller, the Secretary should ensure that the party only collects personal data when necessary, that this data is stored with adequate safeguards, that access to this data is limited, and that members are aware of the party's privacy policy (for which the Secretary is responsible).

The NEC must ensure that newly elected officers understand their roles and responsibilities under the law, where applicable, and that they understand their departmental aims and are aware of the resources available to run them. Any officer may be supported in their role by additional non-elected deputies when the need arises and when the resources are available.

The NEC can vote to appoint or remove these optional roles as needed.

## (6) FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS
The NEC shall designate a voting NEC member who is responsible to the party for the management of the party’s finances.

## (7) DISSOLUTION OF THE PARTY
The party may be dissolved by a simple majority of members making clear their wish to dissolve the party. Any assets belonging to the party at the time of dissolution will be donated to a registered charity of the NEC’s choosing.

## (9) ELECTIONS
### Election Types
All elected  positions shall be elected using the ERS97 STV process both for internal NEC and selectioning candidate for external  elections.

### Nominations
When an election is due, the NEC will announce the opening of nominations. Upon opening, the NEC will publish the date and time that nominations close. The duration of the nomination period must be no less than 14 days and no more than 31 days. This duration may not be altered except as defined below.

Nominations will remain open indefinitely if no nominations are received. Should a nomination occur after this period, nominations must remain open for a minimum of 14 days from the date of a nomination being made.

Open nominations must be announced by the NEC at least every 26 weeks.

Unless constitutionally indicated otherwise, members may nominate themselves as a candidate for election.

Nominated candidates must be Party members in Good Standing (as defined in Section 10).

### Seconding
All elected national positions require that candidates be seconded by a Party member in Good Standing.

Members may only second one candidate per position. Members may not second any candidates in any election they are contesting.

### Campaigning
Campaigning opens to coincide with the closing of nominations. Should the opening of campaigning be delayed, this additional time is to be considered an extension to the nomination period. Campaigning must remain open for no less than 7 days and normally no more than 31 days.

### Voting
Voting must open to coincide with the closing of campaigning. Should the opening of voting be delayed, this additional time is to be considered an extension to the campaigning period. Voting must remain open for no less than 7 days and normally no more than 31 days.

### Exclusions
A member is excluded from standing for election and holding an elected position if they are not in Good Standing (as defined in Section 10).

Some elected positions exclude those who already hold another elected position.

### Election Terms
Elections must be held no less frequently than every 25 months for all positions on the NEC, irrespective of how long each officer has been in post.

### Electorate
All party members in Good Standing (as defined in Section 10) are eligible to vote in all elections unless otherwise specified in this constitution.

### Extraordinary Elections
When an elected position is vacant outside of the normal election terms, an election process for the position will be held following the rules in Section 9. These extraordinary procedures should ordinarily begin within 30 days of the position becoming vacant.

### Election Procedures
The NEC is responsible for making sure all election and vote procedures are followed.

In an STV election, "RON (Re-Open Nominations)" will be listed as a "virtual candidate".

If RON wins any of the open positions, then the election is re-run.

Any candidates that won more votes than RON will be elected on the strength of the initial election. A fresh election will be run for any remaining seats to be filled.

### Candidate Selection Process for External Elections

In cases where the nomination process for external elections (e.g., Supranational, Westminster parliamentary, or local elections) cannot be completed within the specified deadline or under exceptional circumstances, the Pirate Party UK shall follow an alternative process to ensure candidate selection and representation.

### Fallback Process
For external elections, the following fallback options may be considered by the NEC if the nomination process cannot be completed within the specified deadline or under exceptional circumstances:

1. NEC Vote (Second Preference): In exceptional cases where both the ERS97 STV and RON processes cannot be completed, the National Executive Committee (NEC) shall conduct a vote to select candidates for external elections.

2. NEC Deferment to Local Branch: The NEC may choose to delegate the candidate selection process for external elections to the Local Branch if it deems it necessary or appropriate. Such a decision should take into account local factors, local expertise, and the principles of the Pirate Party UK.

## (10) ARBITRATION AND DISCIPLINE
### Incompatible Memberships
If a member of the Party subsequently joins an organization that the Board declares to be incompatible with membership of the Party, or if the member is found to be a member of such an organization, then the Board may revoke their membership of the Party without return of membership fees.

### Votes of No Confidence
A vote of no confidence in any elected official will be triggered when either 50% or more of the fully paid-up membership or over 50% of the NEC make their desire for a vote of no confidence known to the NEC.

When a vote of no confidence has been triggered, the Board will arrange for a vote of party members to ascertain the confidence of the electorate in the elected official, which will conclude within at most 28 days. The officer will be dismissed if a simple majority of eligible members who take part in that vote, vote in favor of dismissal, subject to a quorum of 10% of eligible members.

### Voting Eligibility for Votes of No Confidence
The eligibility of a member to vote in a particular vote of no confidence will be based on whether that member would be eligible to vote for the elected position as per rules in Section 9.

### Good Standing
A member is regarded as being in Good Standing if they are a paid-up member and have not had their position of Good Standing stripped from them.


## Section 11: REPLACEMENT OF OFFICERS IN AN EMERGENCY

In the event of an emergency or an urgent need to replace an officer on the National Executive Committee (NEC) before a regular election can be held, the following process will apply:

1. **Identification of Emergency Due to Exceptional Circumstances**: Any member of the NEC or the Party may identify the need for an emergency replacement of an officer due to exceptional circumstances. The emergency could arise from reasons such as resignation, incapacitation, or any situation where the continued absence of the officer may significantly hinder the functioning of the Party, specifically for the positions of Leader, Treasurer, Nominating Officer, or any other Officer deemed critical to the Party's operation.

2. **Emergency Officer Selection**: The NEC, upon receiving notice of the emergency, shall convene a special emergency meeting within 7 day to consider the situation. During this meeting, the NEC will evaluate the emergency and decide whether an interim replacement is necessary.

4. **Notification**: The NEC shall promptly notify all Party members of the emergency appointment and the reasons for it. The notification should also include the date when a regular election to fill the vacant position will take place.

5. **Regular Election**: A regular election to fill the vacant officer position shall be held within 30 days of the emergency appointment, as per the standard election procedures outlined in Section 9. The interim officer may choose to stand for election during this process if they wish to continue in the role.

6. **Consequences of  Failed Replacement with interim officers**: If, despite reasonable efforts, the Party is unable to appoint interim officers to critical positions (such as Leader, Treasurer, Nominating Officer, or other Officers deemed vital for the Party's operation) during an emergency, and this situation persists for 29 days despite attempts to resolve it, the Party shall cease to exist as an organization.

In such a case, the Party shall take all necessary steps to initiate the dissolution process. Any remaining Party assets, after settling outstanding obligations, shall be donated to a registered charity.

NEC members who are unable to attend are expected to provide advance apologies.

Other participants may join at the invitation of an NEC member, subject to no objections from other committee members.

Meetings are typically action-oriented and follow a set agenda, with occasional additional agenda items agreed upon in advance.

During meetings, each officer on the NEC provides updates regarding their department's activities from the previous week and outlines plans for the upcoming week.

Decision-making in NEC typically requires consensus; decisions can be made during meetings or via email. In the event of a tie, the Leader holds one additional vote.

Minutes of the meeting or/and audio recordings are available for members to review after the meeting.
