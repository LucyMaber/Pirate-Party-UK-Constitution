### Nominations
When an election is due, the NEC will announce the opening of nominations. Upon opening, the NEC will publish the date and time that nominations close. The duration of the nomination period must be no less than 14 days and no more than 31 days. This duration may not be altered except as defined below.

Nominations will remain open indefinitely if no nominations are received. Should a nomination occur after this period, nominations must remain open for a minimum of 14 days from the date of a nomination being made.

Open nominations must be announced by the NEC at least every 26 weeks.

Unless constitutionally indicated otherwise, members may nominate themselves as a candidate for election.

Nominated candidates must be Party members in Good Standing (as defined in Section 10).

### Seconding
All elected national positions require that candidates be seconded by a Party member in Good Standing.

Members may only second one candidate per position. Members may not second any candidates in any election they are contesting.

### Campaigning
Campaigning opens to coincide with the closing of nominations. Should the opening of campaigning be delayed, this additional time is to be considered an extension to the nomination period. Campaigning must remain open for no less than 7 days and normally no more than 31 days.

### Voting
Voting must open to coincide with the closing of campaigning. Should the opening of voting be delayed, this additional time is to be considered an extension to the campaigning period. Voting must remain open for no less than 7 days and normally no more than 31 days.

### Exclusions
A member is excluded from standing for election and holding an elected position if they are not in Good Standing (as defined in Section 10).

Some elected positions exclude those who already hold another elected position.

### Election Terms
Elections must be held no less frequently than every 25 months for all positions on the NEC, irrespective of how long each officer has been in post.

### Electorate
All party members in Good Standing (as defined in Section 10) are eligible to vote in all elections unless otherwise specified in this constitution.

### Extraordinary Elections
When an elected position is vacant outside of the normal election terms, an election process for the position will be held following the rules in Section 9. These extraordinary procedures should ordinarily begin within 30 days of the position becoming vacant.

### Election Procedures
The NEC is responsible for making sure all election and vote procedures are followed.

In an STV election, "RON (Re-Open Nominations" will be listed as a "virtual candidate".

If RON wins any of the open positions, then the election is re-run.

Any candidates that won more votes than RON will be elected on the strength of the initial election. A fresh election will be run for any remaining seats to be filled.

## (10) ARBITRATION AND DISCIPLINE
### Incompatible Memberships
If a member of the Party subsequently joins an organization that the Board declares to be incompatible with membership of the Party, or if the member is found to be a member of such an organization, then the Board may revoke their membership of the Party without return of membership fees.

### Votes of No Confidence
A vote of no confidence in any elected official will be triggered when either 50% or more of the fully paid-up membership or over 50% of the NEC make their desire for a vote of no confidence known to the NEC.

When a vote of no confidence has been triggered, the Board will arrange for a vote of party members to ascertain the confidence of the electorate in the elected official, which will conclude within at most 28 days. The officer will be dismissed if a simple majority of eligible members who take part in that vote, vote in favor of dismissal, subject to a quorum of 10% of eligible members.

### Voting Eligibility for Votes of No Confidence
The eligibility of a member to vote in a particular vote of no confidence will be based on whether that member would be eligible to vote for the elected position as per rules in Section 9.

### Good Standing
A member is regarded as being in Good Standing if they are a paid-up member and have not had their position of Good Standing stripped from them.
